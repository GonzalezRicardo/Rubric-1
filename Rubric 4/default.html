  <p> Hey my name is Ricardo Gonzalez, I am a freshman here at <i>Northwest Vista College</i>. I first attended this school in the beggining of summer, right out of Highschool.	Before college, I graduated from <i>John Jay Highshool</i>, located west of San Antonio. Its been two years since I set foot at John Jay. Overall, I am a dedicated <b>NVC</b> student	looking to earn a major in <i>Digital Media. </i> So far through this journey ive learned a lot from different teachers and former classmates. Things that id never thought id 	ever know of. I have been lucky enough to be a part of many projects throughout the semesters in video, audio, desing and even marketing. </p>

 <h4> Breif story of my life </h4>
    <p> I was born in a small town in <i>Mexico</i> called <i>Charcas</i>, located west of <i> San Luis Potosi, Mexico.</i> A very small area where everybody knew each other. I cant talk much about my 	experience living there because I was so little when I left. My parents reason for leaving was to give my older brother and I, a better future. They left everything they had for us. 	At that time, I was a baby. We moved to the states when I was two and a half years old, along with my big brother who was 3. Ever since then, I have lived in the same area not	to far from where I live now. </p>
    <p>My life goal is to become a successful graphic designer and be able to live a stable life with no worries.  Some things I would like to improve throughout my journey is my communication and creativity 	skills. I'd like to improve them to the point where they get noticed, by bigger clients. I wanna be able to say that I've made my dreams come true. For the most part, I wanna make my parents proud of what they've help raise. I wanna be able to live my life with a career that I love doing. </p>
